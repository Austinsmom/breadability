          <h1>breadability - another readability Python port</h1>

<p>I've tried to work with the various forks of some ancient codebase that ported
<code>readability</code>_ to Python. The lack of tests, unused regex's, and commented out
sections of code in other Python ports just drove me nuts.</p>

<p>I put forth an effort to bring in several of the better forks into one
codebase, but they've diverged so much that I just can't work with it.</p>

<p>So what's any sane person to do? Re-port it with my own repo, add some tests,
infrastructure, and try to make this port better. OSS FTW (and yea, NIH FML,
but oh well I did try)</p>

<p>This is a pretty straight port of the JS here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/arc90labs-readability/source/browse/trunk/js/readability.js#82">http://code.google.com/p/arc90labs-readability/source/browse/trunk/js/readability.js#82</a></li>
</ul><h2>Installation</h2>

<p>This does depend on lxml so you'll need some C headers in order to install
things from pip so that it can compile.</p>

<p>::</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev
pip install breadability
</code></pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>cmd line</p>

<pre><code>
::

    $ breadability http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide

Options
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>b will write out the parsed content to a temp file and open it in a
browser for viewing.</li>
<li>d will write out debug scoring statements to help track why a node was
chosen as the document and why some nodes were removed from the final
product.</li>
<li>f will override the default behaviour of getting an html fragment ( )
and give you back a full  document.
<li>v will output in verbose debug mode and help let you know why it parsed
how it did.</li>


<p>Using from Python</p>

<pre><code>
::

    from breadability.readable import Article
    doc = Article(html_text, url=url_came_from)
    print doc.readable


Work to be done
---------------
Yep, I've got some catching up to do. I don't do pagination, I've got a lot of
custom tweaks I need to get going, there are some articles that fail to parse.
I also have more tests to write on a lot of the cleaning helpers, but
hopefully things are setup in a way that those can/will be added.

Fortunately, I need this library for my tools:

- https://bmark.us
- http://readable.bmark.us

so I really need this to be an active and improving project.


Off the top of my heads todo list:

  - Support metadata from parsed article [url, confidence scores, all
    candidates we thought about?]
  - More tests, more thorough tests
  - More sample articles we need to test against in the test_articles
  - Tests that run through and check for regressions of the test_articles
  - Tidy'ing the HTML that comes out, might help with regression tests ^^
  - Multiple page articles
  - Performance tuning, we do a lot of looping and re-drop some nodes that
    should be skipped. We should have a set of regression tests for this so
    that if we implement a change that blows up performance we know it right
    away.
  - More docs for things, but sphinx docs and in code comments to help
    understand wtf we're doing and why. That's the biggest hurdle to some of
    this stuff.

Helping out
------------
If you want to help, shoot me a pull request, an issue report with broken
urls, etc.

You can ping me on irc, I'm always in the `#bookie` channel in freenode.
